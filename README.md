# PokeStore

This project is part of the [Gama Experience](https://gama.academy/) bootcamp in order to apply PBL (project based learning).

# Introduction

For this challenge, I had to build a pokemon store by fetching data from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).
The MVP consisted of:

- Products catalog
- Shopping cart
- Shopping cart summary

I added a couple of features:

- Pokemon searching
- Empty cart when checking out

# Technologies

- ReactJS (functional using hooks)
- Bootstrap
- Good coffee machine

# Running locally

If you want, you can clone this repository and run the project locally running `npm start` or `yarn start`.
